CS121: Schelling Model of Housing Segregation

  Program for simulating a variant of Schelling's model of
  housing segregation.  This program takes six parameters:

    filename -- name of a file containing a sample city grid

    R - The radius of the neighborhood: a home at Location (k, l) is in
        the neighborhood of the home at Location (i,j) if 0 <= k < N,
        0 <= l < N, and 0 <= |i-k| + |j-l| <= R.

    similarity_satisfaction_range (lower bound and upper bound) -
         acceptable range for ratio of the number of
         homes of a similar color to the number
         of occupied homes in a neighborhood.

   patience - number of satisfactory homes that must be visited before choosing
              the last one visited.

   max_steps - the maximum number of passes to make over the city
               during a simulation.

  Sample: python3 schelling.py --grid_file=tests/a20-sample-writeup.txt --r=1
         --sim_lb=0.40 --sim_ub=0.7 --patience=3 --max_steps=1
  The sample command is shown on two lines, but should be entered on
  a single line in the linux command-line
